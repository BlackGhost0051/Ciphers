# One time pad cipher

The One Time Pad (OTP) cipher is a cryptographic method that uses a key sequence that is the same length as the message.

OTP is considered to be absolutely secure because each key is used only once, and a correctly chosen key can solve any other key with the same length, which can be decrypted in any desired way.
